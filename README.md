# codebusters

i made this mainly because a lot of the online practice tools for codebusters were super clunky and annoying to work with. 
this file allows you to quickly work with most of the ciphers in a much more streamlined, easy-to-use command line format.

the ciphers are explained much more in depth over here: https://scioly.org/wiki/index.php/Codebusters
